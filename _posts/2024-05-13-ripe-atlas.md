I'm proud to announce that I became [RIPE NCC](https://www.ripe.net) ambassador and that you can pick up an Atlas probe from me at this years [DORS/CLUC conference](https://www.dorscluc.org).

## What is RIPE Atlas?

RIPE Atlas is a global network of probes that measure Internet connectivity and reachability, providing an unprecedented understanding of the state of the Internet in real time.

There are thousands of active probes in the RIPE Atlas network, and it is continually growing. The RIPE NCC collects data from this network and provides Internet maps, data tools and visualisations based on the aggregated results. RIPE Atlas users who host a probe can also use the entire RIPE Atlas network to conduct [customised measurements](https://atlas.ripe.net/about/customised-measurements) that provide valuable data about their own network.

Read more at their [official site](https://atlas.ripe.net/about/).

## What do you get from hosting a probe?

- Continuously monitor network reachability from thousands of vantage points around the globe
- Investigate and troubleshoot network issues with quick, flexible connectivity checks
- Create alarms using RIPE Atlas status checks, which work with your own monitoring tools
- Check the responsiveness of DNS infrastructure, such as root name servers
- Test IPv6 connectivity

## How to get one?

Look for me at the SmartAccount booth (there will be a paper saying pick up your probes here) or fill in the [form here](https://forms.gle/fL8z2dHyJ3bQUbZb8).
