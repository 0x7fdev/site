With help from ÄŒedo, I managed to buy equipment needed to get my lab up and running. With equipment I also bought some components and started tinkering on this project that I was looking forward since May. TeaBot will be an ice cream box robot with wheels. Its purpose is to teach my self about robotics and electronics.

## 1st milestone - "Eyes" and LCD

Using this sonar like contraption and some code I made eyes for robot to see distances to obstacles. Next, for debugging purpose, I added an LCD to display the name of the robot and distance data. :)

Video of the bot in action:
