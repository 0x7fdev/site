Welcome to andreicek.eu!

My name is Andrei and I am your hobby electronics host. I am 18 years old and always wanted my YouTube series but I never got to it. Since last few years I have taken an interest in electronics and microcontrollers so this will be the main theme throughout the website and the YouTube channel. (UPDATE: No it wont.)

Currently I am still in high school (UPDATE: Still no.) but after the summer I am starting University College for Applied Computer Engineering, Software engineering. Apart from electronics and software my interests are languages, traveling, collecting stickers and cooking. A bit weird combination of likes!

So anyways thank you for looking at my new “project” and I hope that you will like it. New videos are coming our way soon! (UPDATE: And they never did.)

//Andrei
