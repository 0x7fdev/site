title: Undefined vs. null

This is a very interesting today I learned about JavaScript.

Letâ€™s say you have a function `friendEmail`:

```javascript
class User {
  get friendEmail() {
    const { sharedEmail } = this.data;

    return sharedEmail ? this.data.email : undefined;
  }
}
```

Reviewing this, as I did, you might leave a comment saying:

> Should we return null here instead of undefined?

And you would we wrong! As per TC39 documentation about `null`[^1] you can see the following:

> 4.4.15 null value
>
> primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any object value

So a function that returns a primitive[^2] should in the abstinence of value return an `undefined` and a function that returns an object type should return `null`.

Keep in mind that returning a null wont however be switching return types, since `null` it self is a primitive but it only represents absence of any object value.

Weird stuff, right?
