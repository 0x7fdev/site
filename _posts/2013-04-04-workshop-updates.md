In the month of June I will be renovating my workshop. Upon completion you can expect much more tutorials, projects and videos. I have a few projects that I want to work on so I will list them here in the order that you can expect them appearing on the site and the channel.

Projects for summer of 2013:

- Remote controlled power sockets (complete with source code, packaging and schematics)
- _DONE_ Raspberry Pi as a workshop Arduino programmer with connection to GitHub to pull projects on the device
- Geiger counter

and thats all for now. I hope to add more as time passes by. The first completed post should be one about renovation projects with photos and videos.

UPDATE:

This week I managed to get some time and I cleaned up the place. Now all we are waiting for is a desk top plank to finish the work shop. After that I can start working on some projects.
