title: Did you ever lose this in JavaScript?

A few days ago I've asked my team a trick question -- what will be logged in this code example:

<!--more-->

```JavaScript
class User {
  constructor(fullName) {
    this.fullName = fullName;
  }

  print() {
    console.log(this.fullName);
  }
}

class Test {
  constructor() {
    this.fullName = 'nope';
  }

  run(cb) {
    cb();
  }
}

const t = new Test();
const u = new User('0x7f');

t.run(u.print);
```

Devs who still don't hate JavaScript will respond with `0x7f`. But that's not true. In fact - this will result in an exception. `this` is undefined. Let's see why.
Ever since `class` was introduced to JavaScirpt it's been nothing more than just a syntax sugar for functions. Observe this simple example:

```javascript
function User(fullName) {
  this.fullName = fullName;

  this.print = function () {
    console.log(this.fullName);
  };
}
```

This is the same piece of code like the `User` from the above example. And it sheds a bit more light on why exactly our code does not work. Take the following usage:

```javascript
const u = new User("0x7f");
const print = u.print;

print();
```

Now if we run this in a browser console you'll get `undefined`. Why? Because it's using `window` as parent scope, and `window` does not have a `fullName` property.

The main reason why we even get `window` here (in browser), or nothing in a module (webpack, ts, w/e) is because of the way JavaScript handles references. When we passed a function reference `u.print` we de facto lost the information about the scope we wanted. And when we don't have a scope defined we look for a parent one.

If you still don't quite <em>get</em> the reason why first example doesn't work - take a look at this:

```javascript
const t = new Test();
const u = new User("0x7f");

const print = u.print;

t.run(print);
```

## How do I fix this then?

There are two ways of fixing this to do the intended. First one is well known to React (pre-hook) devs:

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(fullName) {
    this.fullName = fullName;

    this.print = this.print.bind(this);
  }

  print() {
    console.log(this.fullName);
  }
}
```

This will make the `u.print` forever bound to the `User` scope.

The other solution, one that I do not like -- is using arrow functions instead of `bind`:

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(fullName) {
    this.fullName = fullName;

    this.print = () =&gt; console.log(this.fullName);
  }
}
```
